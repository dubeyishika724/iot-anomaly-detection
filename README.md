# IoT Anomaly Detection for Smart Home Systems

An ML-based system that detects abnormal behavior in smart home IoT sensor data such as temperature, humidity and motion. The project applies Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and Autoencoder models to identify unusual sensor patterns and improve smart home security.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow  
- Power BI  

## Project Objective
To automatically detect abnormal sensor behavior in smart homes and support security monitoring and device fault detection.

## Key Features
- Time-series data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering using rolling statistics  
- Multiple anomaly detection algorithms  
- Dashboard-based visualization of anomalies  

## Future Scope
- Real-time monitoring  
- Alert system integration  
- Edge-device deployment
